In this chapter we present the algorithm variants that we have implemented and evaluated. In \textbf{Section~\ref{algo:overview}} we give an overview of various state-of-the-art compression algorithms, including their parameters and our masking/non-masking variants. In \textbf{Section~\ref{algo:details}} we describe the general encoding scheme used for every algorithm variant, while in \textbf{Section~\ref{algo:maskmodes}} we propose a general strategy to compress gaps in the masking variants, using arithmetic coding combined with a Krichevskyâ€“Trofimov probability assignment over a Markov model. In \textbf{Section~\ref{algo:base}} we present algorithm Base, which is a trivial algorithm that serves as a base ground for the compression performance comparison developed in Chapter~\ref{experiments}. In \textbf{sections~\ref{algo:pca}} to \textbf{\ref{algo:gamps}} we present the variants implemented for eight different algorithms, showing their coding and decoding routines, and describing an example that shows the encoding process step by step. Finally, in \textbf{Section~\ref{algo:adddetails}} we present additional implementation details.
