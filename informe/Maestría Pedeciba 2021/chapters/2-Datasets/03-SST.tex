\section{Dataset SST}
\label{datasets:sst}
\newcommand{\TAODef}{This dataset is collected by the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) project, which was established in 1985 to study annual climate variations near the equator \cite{dataset:tao}.}

Dataset SST \cite{dataset:sst1} consists of \textit{Sea Surface Temperature (SST)} measurements from buoys floating in the Pacific Ocean. \TAODef


The dataset consists of readings from 55 buoys, which can be located in the map presented in \cite{dataset:sst1}. For each timestamp, the dataset contains the SST measurement taken in each buoy. Thus, a total of 55 data samples are stored for each timestamp. The temperature is measured in degree Celsius (°C), with a precision of three significant figures. Every sample value is transformed into the integer domain by multiplying it by $10^3$.

In Table~\ref{datasets:table:sst} we present some statistics of dataset SST. The data for each month is stored in a separate csv file, and every row in the table contains statistics of a different file. \commonTable (in °C).
