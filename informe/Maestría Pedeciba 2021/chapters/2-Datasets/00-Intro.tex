In this chapter we present the datasets used in our experiments. Every dataset consists of signals with either one or both of the characteristics we are interested in, namely, irregular sampling rate and data gaps. In Chapter~\ref{experiments}, we present our experimental results, which make use of these datasets to analyze the performance of various compression algorithms, which are presented in Chapter~\ref{algo}.


The datasets come from multiple sources \dataCite, each using a different data representation format. We transformed all the data into a consistent, homogeneous format, which can be easily adapted to represent different kinds of datasets. In Section~\ref{datasets:over} we describe said format, including an example file that shows how the data is represented. In the following eight sections we present every dataset, namely, IRKIS, SST, ADCP, ElNino, Solar, Hail, Tornado, and Wind, laying out the source, characteristics and relevant statistics of every signal involved. In Section~\ref{datasets:summary} we summarize the information presented in this chapter, describing the amount of gaps, and the number of files and data types of each dataset.
