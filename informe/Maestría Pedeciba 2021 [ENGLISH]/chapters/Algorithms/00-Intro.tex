In this chapter we present the coding algorithms implemented for evaluation. In Section~\ref{algo:overview} we give an overview of the various algorithms, including their parameters and masking variants. In Section~\ref{algo:details} we describe the general encoding scheme used for every evaluated algorithm, while in Section~\ref{algo:maskmodes} we propose a general strategy to compress gaps, using arithmetic coding combined with a Krichevskyâ€“Trofimov probability assignment over a Markov model. In Section~\ref{algo:base} we present algorithm Base, which is a trivial algorithm that serves as a base ground for the compression performance comparison developed in Chapter~\ref{experiments}. In sections~\ref{algo:pca} to \ref{algo:gamps} we present each of the 8 implemented algorithms, showing their coding and decoding routines, and describing an example that shows the encoding process step by step. In Section~\ref{algo:details} we present additional implementation details.
