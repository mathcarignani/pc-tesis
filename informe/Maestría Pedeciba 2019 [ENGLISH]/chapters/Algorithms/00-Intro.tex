In this chapter we present the coding algorithms implemented and evaluated in the project. In Section~\ref{algo:overview} we give an overview of the different algorithms, including their parameters and masking variants. In Section~\ref{algo:details} we describe the general encoding scheme used for every algorithm, while in Section~\ref{algo:maskmodes} we explain the approach taken to compress the gaps, using arithmetic coding with KT probability assignment. In Section~\ref{algo:base} we present algorithm Base, which is a trivial algorithm that serves as a base ground for the compression performance comparison developed in Chapter~\ref{experiments}. In sections \ref{algo:pca} and \ref{algo:apca} we present algorithms PCA and APCA, respectively, which are the Constant model algorithms that we implemented. In Section~\ref{algo:decolinear} we describe the encoding scheme used by the Linear model algorithms, including the description of a routine used by every decoder. In sections~\ref{algo:pwlh}, \ref{algo:ca}, \ref{algo:sf}, and \ref{algo:fr}, we present algorithms PWLH and PWLHInt, CA, SF, and FR, respectively, which are the Linear model algorithms that we implemented. In Section~\ref{algo:gamps} we present GAMPS, a Correlation model algorithm. For every one of the algorithms, we show its coding routine, and describe an example that shows the encoding process step by step.
