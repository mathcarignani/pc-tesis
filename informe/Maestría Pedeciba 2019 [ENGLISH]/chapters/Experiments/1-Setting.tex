\section{Experimental Setting}
\label{experiments:experiments}


We evaluate the compression performance of all the coding algorithms presented in Chapter~\ref{coders} on the datasets described in Chapter~\ref{datasets}. For each algorithm we test both the masking and the non-masking mode (except for $\coderBase$, \textit{CoderFR} and \textit{CoderSF}, which only operate in non-masking mode).


We also test several combinations of algorithm parameters. Specifically, for the algorithms that admit a window size parameter $w$ (every algorithm except $\coderBase$ and \textit{CoderSF}), we test all the values of $w$ in the set $W = \{4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256\}$. For the encoders that admit a lossy compression mode with a threshold parameter $e$ (every encoder except $\coderBase$), we test all the values of $e$ in the set $E= \{1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30\}$, where each threshold is expressed as a percentage fraction of the standard deviation of the data type being coded. For example, for a certain data type with a standard deviation of 20, taking $e=10$ implies that the lossy compression allows for a maximum sample distortion of 2.

\begin{defcion}
We refer to a specific combination of a coding algorithm and its parameter values as a \textit{coding algorithm instance (CAI)}. We define \textit{CI} as the set of all the CAIs obtained by combining each of the algorithms presented in Chapter~\ref{coders} with the parameter values (from $W$ and $E$) which are suitable for that algorithm.
\end{defcion}


We assess the compression performance of a CAI mainly through the compression ratio, which we define next. For that definition, we recall that $\coderBase$ is a trivial encoder that serves as a base ground for compression performance comparison.

\begin{defcion}
Let $f$ be a file and let $z$ be a data type of a certain dataset introduced in Chapter~\ref{datasets}. We define $f_z$ as the subset of data of type $z$ from file $f$.
\end{defcion}


\vspace{+2pt}
\begin{defcion}
The \textit{compression ratio (CR)} of a CAI $\algo \in \ca$ for the data of type $z$ of a certain file $f$ is given by
\vspace{-5pt}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:compression-rate}
\tasacompresion(\algo, f_z) = 100\times\frac{|\algo(f_z)|}{|\coderBase(f_z)|},
\end{equation}
where $|\algo(f_z)|$ and $|\coderBase(f_z)|$ are the sizes of the resulting files obtained when coding $f_z$ with $\algo$ and $\coderBase$, respectively.
\end{defcion}


The performance of $\algo$ improves as $|\algo(f_z)|$ decreases. Thus, our main goals are to analyze which CAIs minimize equation (\ref{eq:compression-rate}) for the different data types, and to study how do the coding algorithms and the values of their parameters influence the result of this equation.


To compare the compression performance between a pair of CAIs we calculate the relative difference, which we define next. In general, it only makes sense to compare CAIs that have the same threshold parameter $e$.


\vspace{+5pt}
\begin{defcion}
The \textit{relative difference (RD)} between a pair of CAIs $\algo_1, \algo_2 \in {\ca}$ for the data of type $z$ of a certain file $f$ is given by
\vspace{-5pt}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:relative-difference}
\difrelativa(\algo_1, \algo_2, f_z)  =
100\times\frac{|\algo_2 (f_z)| - |\algo_1 (f_z)|}{ |\algo_2 (f_z)| },
\end{equation}
where $|\algo_1(f_z)|$ and $|\algo_2(f_z)|$ are the sizes of the resulting files obtained when coding $f_z$ with $\algo_1$ and $\algo_2$, respectively. 
\end{defcion}


$\algo_1$ has a better performance than $\algo_2$ when the result of equation (\ref{eq:relative-difference}) is a positive value. As said value increases, the relative performance of $\algo_1$ with respect to $\algo_2$ improves.
