In this chapter we present our experimental results. The main goal of our experiments is to analyze the performance of each of the coding algorithms presented in Chapter~\ref{algo}, by encoding the various datasets introduced in Chapter~\ref{datasets}. In Section~\ref{experiments:experiments} we describe our experimental setting, defining the evaluated combinations of algorithms and parameter values, and the figures of merit used for comparison. In Section~\ref{secX:rendimiento-relativo} we compare the compression performance of the masking and non-masking variants for each coding algorithm. The results suggest that the masking variant is more robust and performs better in general. In Section~\ref{secX:windows} we analyze the extent to which the window size parameter impacts on the performance of the algorithms. The results indicate that the impact of using the global window instead of the local window on the compression performance of the coding algorithms is rather small. In Section~\ref{secX:codersmask} we compare the performance of the different algorithms among each other and with the general purpose compression algorithm gzip. ...
