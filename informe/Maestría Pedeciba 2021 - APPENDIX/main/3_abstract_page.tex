This document includes each plot figure generated from the experimental results obtained in our work. In \textbf{Appendix~\ref{plots32}} we present the figures corresponding to Section~4.2 (Comparison of Masking and Non-Masking Variants). In \textbf{Appendix~\ref{plots33}} we present the figures corresponding to Section~4.3 (Window Size Parameter). Finally, in \textbf{Appendix~\ref{plots34}} we present the figures corresponding to Section~4.4 (Algorithm Compression Performance).
