1. Run the program
The user can simply invoke run.sh to start the program. Sometimes, there may be some problems due to the permissions to read/write files and
folders. In that case, the user should change the permission settings accordingly.

The input of data of the program are put in testingData/_DATA_. They should have.csv extension to ensure that everything runs successfully.
Before starting the program, the user should check the subdirectories of testingData. Only _DATA_ is allowed to have files (the input of the
process). Other subdirectories are reserved for ouput data. Each one should have 3 subdirectories, namely approxData, compressedData and
statistic.

A very important issue is that the user should modify the config.ini approriately, as the paths to input and output folder are all read from
this file. Inapproriate config.ini information may result in wrong result.

2. More detailed explanation
When run.sh starts, everything will proceed as follows:
- Step 1: clean.sh is invoked to remove all files in the subdirectories of testingData, except for input files in testingData/_DATA_
- Step 2: the compilation process is started by calling the script compile.sh.
- Step 3: after compiling the program successfully, the executable is called and compression algorithms are executed. The output of each
algorithm is put in the respective subdirectory inside testingData. There are 6 algorihms implemented: CHEB, APCA, PCA, PWLH, SF, GAMPS.
